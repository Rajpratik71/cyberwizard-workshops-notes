# getting started

Welcome to Cyber Wizard Institute!

Most days, we will have presentations covering important programming
fundamentals. However, the bulk of the time is dedicated to open hacking and
learning, with facilitators hovering around to help when you get stuck or if you
have questions.

We are all learners and teachers, so it's good to talk to other students, team
up, ask each other questions, and share!

We will have time at the end of each day for anyone who has anything to share to
get up and share something they've learned.

# project ideas

To get the most out of Cyber Wizard Institute, it helps to have some concrete
project ideas. If you can't think of anything, here are some ideas to get you
started:

* personal blog
* a web-based 2d game
* automating mundane tasks
* twitter or IRC bot to generate silly text
* interactive art
* generating music with algorithms
* visualizations and info-graphics
* virtual reality
* image manipulation

If you need help about where to start with any of these ideas, ask a mentor for
guidance!

# homework

To get some programming practice, we recommend
[nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/).

However, don't feel as if you need to get through all the nodeschool levels or
do them in order. If you get stuck for too long on a lesson, just skip it and
move on.

It's good to have a concrete real-world project or two to supplement nodeschool.

# configuring your system

To get the most out of Cyber Wizard Institute, you will need a computer running
Mac OSX or Linux. If your computer runs Windows, we can help you install Linux.

## system package manager

If you are on Mac OSX, you will need to install
[xcode](https://www.apple.com/xcode/), then you can install 
[homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

If you are on linux, you will most likely already have a package manager
installed. You're already done!

## system software

During the course, we are going to make heavy use of:

* git
* node.js
* npm

In debian or ubuntu you can do:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git nodejs npm build-essential
$ sudo ln -s `which nodejs` /usr/share/local/bin
```

On Mac OSX you can do:

```
$ brew install git nodejs
```

For different lectures and projects you will need to install more software to
follow along, but these should get you in a good state for the rest of the
lessons.
